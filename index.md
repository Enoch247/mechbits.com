## About Me
I am a computer engineer by profession. My favorite projects are the ones that require me to wear both my software and hardware hats. I also very much enjoy photography and lately have been exploring flash photography. Some of my hobby projects (including the tools to build this site) can be found [here](https://github.com/Enoch247). However, the thing I enjoy doing the most is spending time with my wife and kids.

## Words to Live by
- "All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." - Edmund Burke

- "Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far." - Theodore Roosevelt

- If the only tool you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail.

- If you compete against yourself, you'll always win.

- Figure out what you want, before somebody does it for you.

- "Working hard for something we don't care about is called stress. Working hard for something we love is called passion." - Simon Sinek
