## About Me

I am a computer engineer by profession. My favorite projects are the ones that require me to wear both my software and hardware hats. I also very much enjoy photography and lately have been exploring flash photography. Some of my hobby projects (including the tools to build this site) can be found [here](https://github.com/Enoch247). However, the thing I enjoy doing the most is spending time with my wife and kids.
